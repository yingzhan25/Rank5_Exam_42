## 📋 Exam Structure

### Level 0 - C++ Fundamentals (3 Subjects)

Focuses on advanced C++ concepts and consists of three subjects:

#### 1. **bigint**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Operator overloading
  - Bit manipulation
  - Conversion between string and integer types
- **Skills:** Implementing custom numeric types with arithmetic operations

#### 2. **vect2**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Operator overloading
  - Index search and access
- **Skills:** Creating a 2D vector class with custom operators

#### 3. **polyset**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Diamond inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Interface and abstract classes
  - Deep copy vs. shallow copy
- **Skills:** Complex inheritance hierarchies and proper resource management

### Level 1 - C Programming & Algorithms (2 Subjects)

Focuses on C programming with emphasis on memory management and algorithms:

#### 1. **life**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Matrix copy and modification
  - Memory management
  - Simple algorithms
- **Skills:** Dynamic memory allocation and array manipulation in C

#### 2. **bsq**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Matrix modification
  - Stream function usage
  - File I/O operations
  - Error handling
- **Skills:** Finding the biggest square in a map, parsing, and optimization

## 💡 Checkpoint System

The exam includes a **checkpoint after Level 0**:
- ✅ Pass Level 0 → Checkpoint saved
- 🔄 Next exam attempt → Start directly from Level 1
- ⏱️ Save time by not repeating completed levels


## 📚 Study Tips

1. **Master operator overloading** - Essential for bigint and vect2
2. **Understand inheritance hierarchies** - Critical for polyset
3. **Practice memory management** - Core skill for Level 1
4. **Review matrix algorithms** - Needed for both life and bsq
5. **Know the differences** - Deep vs. shallow copy, polymorphism concepts


**Good luck with your Rank 5 exam! 🎓**
